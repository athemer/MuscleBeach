# MuscleBeach

In a nutshell, this is an online meal ordering app. 

In order to give a better understanding of this app, there are several rules I need you to know about this business model first. 

1. you don't get to choose main course and side dishes for you're meal. Muscle Beach will arrage that for you.

2. This meal is scheduled to delivery at lunch and dinner time. no instant delivery.

3. you can choose the amount of the meal, there will be three different amonunt. 

4. you can either ask Muscle Beach to deliver your meal box to you or pick it up yourself, it's gonna cost you if you need delivery.

5. The more you order at once, the more delivery discount you get.

**5. find others to order together.**
  
   If it rings a bell, customer have to order at least 2 meal box for the same date if they need delivery.
   
   Chances are there will be no others want to order with you ( yes, poor people who have no friend )
